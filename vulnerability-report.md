**Reviewing:** Learning Journal


----------------------

**Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection**

Their is no way for sql injection because the journal entries are put into the database the pyramids **O**bject **R**elational **M**anager.
At this point your app is secure from sql injection as long as pyramids ORM has no known vulnerabilities.

----------------------
**Vulnerability 2: Broken Authentication**

It doesn't look like There is any Broken Authentication
Going to /new-entry route without logging in throws a 403 Forbidden error
Going to /journal/[entry id]/edit-entry route without logging in also throws a 403 Forbidden error

And since there is only one user there is no need to check who the user actually is. It just matters if they're logged in.

----------------------
**Vulnerability 3:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

I'm not sure that Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw exists here just make sure that any javascript you use you trust.

----------------------
**Vulnerability 4:** Insecure Direct Object Reference

Going to /new-entry route without logging in throws a 403 Forbidden error
Going to /journal/[entry id]/edit-entry route without logging in also throws a 403 Forbidden error

Those are the only routes that you don't want anyone accessing so your safe if you add more routes make sure there secure.

----------------------
**Vulnerability 5:** Security Misconfiguration

There is no security misconfiguration as long as you use production.ini when you load it into production.

----------------------
**Vulnerability 6:** Sensitive Data Exposure

There does not seem to be any serious sensitive data exposure. But there can be if you don't use SSL and if you want to be even more secure use strong hashes (SHA 256 or better) with salts for your password.


----------------------
**Vulnerability 7:** Function Level Access Control

Since there is only one user there is no need to check who the user actually is. It just matters if they're logged in.
And both add and edit require the user to be logged in.

----------------------
**Vulnerability 8:** Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Even thought in this branch you do not use CSRF token I know that you changed that in you security branch.
