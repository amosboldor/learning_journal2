"""user story - AJAX."""

1) As an author, I want to be able to submit new entries from the home page, 
so I don’t have to wait for a page reload or an HTTP redirect to see the new
 entry in my list of entries. I should only see this form if I’m authenticated.
2) As an author I want to be able to submit AJAX requests for creating new 
entries or editing existing entries. I shouldn’t need to be on the webpage to 
interact with my website. All I want is access to the Javascript code; it 
doesn’t have to be hooked into my site (except for the above user story).
3) As an author, I want my existing editing to stay functional so that I can 
work from a browser without javascript.
4) As an author I want to be able to tweet the title of a post and a link to that 
post by pressing a button so that I can share what I’ve learned with my followers.
5) Create a Milestone in GitHub to represent these improvements. Break these 
improvements down into tasks, create an issue for each task and assign the tasks 
to the milestone.
